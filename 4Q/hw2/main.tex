					Notes, and use of other aids is allowed.  Read all directions carefully and write your answers in the space provided.  To receive full credit, you must show all of your work. \textbf{Cheating or indications of cheating and similar answers will be punished accordingly}.

		\subsubsection*{Information}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The homework is due primarily on \textbf{Friday}, \textbf{May 19th}. You can submit it on \textbf{Monday}, \textbf{May 22nd}, but the Advanced Problems won't count.
			\item You should Work on it \textbf{in groups} and consult me if you have any questions. As I have reiterated multiple times, cheating between groups will have a serious consequence.
			\item For purposes of neatness and simplicity of grading, you should do the homework on an \textbf{A-4 paper}.

	\end{center}
	
	\begin{questions}
		\question The refractive index of visible light from a material to air is 4.8. What is the speed of light through the material? What is the critical angle for this material?
		\question Light is traveling from water to air.
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item What happens if the angle of incidence is $50^0$?
			\item If light is incident at an angle of $30^0$, what is the angle of refraction?
		\end{enumerate}
		\question When an object is submerged in a medium, it looks as though its nearer to the surface than it actually is when viewed from a outside. Show that, when viewed from almost vertically above, the refractive index of the medium can be given as a ratio of its real depth to the apparent depth.
		\question A ray of 700 nm light goes from air into medium($n=1.8$) at an incident angle of $45^0$. At what incident angle must 500 nm light enter flint glass to have the same angle of refraction? 
		\subsection*{Advanced Problems}
		\question Prove the law of reflection using Huygens' principle.
