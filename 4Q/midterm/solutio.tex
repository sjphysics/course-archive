					\subsubsection*{Workout Problems}
					\question Calculate the ratio of the highest to lowest frequencies of electromagnetic waves the eye can see, given the wavelength range of visible light is from 450 nm to 760 nm. Would we be able to observe and study human cells  which have an average diameter of about $100\mu m$? Why? \\ \\
					One of the frequencies is:
					$$f=\dfrac{c}{\lambda}$$
					$$f=\dfrac{3\times10^8m/s}{450\times10^{-9}m}=6.67\times10^{14}Hz$$
					The other is:
					$$f=\dfrac{c}{\lambda}$$
					$$f=\dfrac{3\times10^8m/s}{750\times10^{-9}m}=4\times10^{14}Hz$$
					The ratio can be calculated as follows;
					$$\dfrac{6.67\times10^{14}Hz}{4\times10^{14}Hz}=\dfrac{6.67}{4}$$
					Another - a much simpler way - to calculate the ratio is relating the two frequencies as a function of their wavelengths:
					$$\dfrac{f_1}{f_2}=\dfrac{\dfrac{c}{\lambda_1}}{\dfrac{c}{\lambda_2}}$$
					$$\dfrac{f_1}{f_2}=\dfrac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}$$
					$$\dfrac{f_1}{f_2}=\dfrac{750nm}{450nm}=\dfrac{750}{450}=\dfrac{15}{9}\approxeq\dfrac{6.67}{4}$$
					\question A scuba diver training in a pool looks at his instructor. What angle does the ray from the instructorâ€™s face make with the perpendicular to the water at the point where the ray enters? The angle between the ray in the water and the perpendicular to the water is $30^0$(The diver is at a depth of 2m below the surface of the water and the instructor is 2m away from the normal).

					The angle given in the question is the angle of incidence. We are asked the angle of refraction. Despite the seemingly-intimidating nature of this question, it is quiet easy. We just have to use Snell's law.
					$$n_1\sin\theta_i=n_2\sin\theta_r$$
					Here, the first medium is water($n=\dfrac{4}{3}$) and the second medium is air($n=1$).
					$$\dfrac{4}{3}\sin30^0=(1)\sin\theta_r$$
					$$\sin\theta=\dfrac{2}{3}$$
					$$\theta=\arcsin\dfrac{2}{3}$$
					\question Light traveling from water($n=1.33$) to a some transparent stone strikes the surface at an incident angle of $60.0^0$ and has an angle of refraction of $37.0^0$.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item What is the speed of light in the stone? \\ \\
						To answer this, we first need to find the refractive index of the stone. To do that, we use Snell's law. The first medium is water and the second medium is the stone and we have been given the angles of incidence and reflection.
						$$n_1\sin\theta_i=n_2\sin\theta_r$$	
						$$(\dfrac{4}{3})\sin60^0=n_2\sin37^0$$
						$$(\dfrac{4}{3})\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=n_2(\dfrac{3}{5})$$
						$$n_2=\dfrac{10\sqrt{3}}{9}$$
						Now that we have the refractive index, we can work out the speed of light in this medium.
						$$n=\dfrac{c}{v}\implies v=\dfrac{c}{n}$$
						$$v=\dfrac{3\times10^{8}m/s}{\dfrac{10\sqrt{3}}{9}}$$
						\item What is the critical angle if light was to travel from the stone to water? \\ \\
						$$\sin\theta_c=\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}$$
						$$\theta_c=\arcsin\dfrac{n_2}{n_1}$$
						$$\theta_c=\arcsin\dfrac{\dfrac{4}{3}}{\dfrac{10\sqrt{3}}{9}}=\arcsin\dfrac{6}{5\sqrt{3}}$$
					\end{itemize}
					\question During normal beating, the heart creates a maximum 4.00-mV potential across 0.350 m of a personâ€™s chest. If the EM wave created has a frequency of 7.00Hz,
					\begin{itemize}
						\item What is the maximum electric field strength created?
						We can find the electric field by using the voltage provided.
						$$E=\dfrac{V}{d}=\dfrac{4\times10^{-3}V}{0.35m}=1.14\times10^{-2}V/m$$
						\item What is the corresponding maximum magnetic field strength in the electromagnetic wave?
						$$E=cB\implies B=\dfrac{E}{c}=\dfrac{1.14\times10^{-2}V/m}{3\times10^{8}m/s}$$
						$$B=3.81\times10^{-11}T$$
					\end{itemize}
