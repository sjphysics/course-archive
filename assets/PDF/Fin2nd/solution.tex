					\subsubsection*{Conceptual \& Proof Problems}
					\question What are the factors affecting the resistance of conductor? List each factor and explain the effects of changing the factors on the resistance. \\ \\
					Read page 2 of \textbf{\textit{Current Notes}}.
					\question Show that relation $R=\dfrac{\rho L}{A}$ follows from the macroscopic form of Ohm's Law($\implies V=IR$) and microscopic form($J=\sigma E$). \\ \\
					Read pages 1\&2 of \textbf{\textit{Further Notes on Capacitance \& Resistance}}.
					\question Consider a region in space where a uniform electric field points in the positive Y direction. \begin{itemize}
						\item What is the orientation of the equipotential surfaces?\\ \\
						Since equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to electric field lines, if the field points in the positive Y direction, our equipotential surfaces should be along an axis perpendicular to the field - which is the X or Z axes.
						\item If you move in the negative Y direction, does electric potential decrease or increase?\\ \\
						We know that electric field is always points from higher potential to lower potential. If I go to the negative Y direction, it is against the field, it means that it is from lower potential to higher potential meaning the potential increases.
					\end{itemize}
					\textit{\textbf{Refer to HW6 Solutions for more information.}}
					\question Why are equipotential lines and surfaces perpendicular to the electric field lines? \\ \\
					The work done to move a charge along an equipotential surface is 0. ($W=q\Delta V=q\times0=0$) since $\Delta V=0$ for an equipotential surface.
					$$W=Fd\cos\theta$$
					$$0=Fd\cos\theta$$
					This means that $\cos\theta=0$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the equipotential surface and the field line. This implies that $\theta=90^0$ \\ \\
					\textbf{\textit{Refer to HW5 Solutions for more information.}}
					\subsubsection*{Workout Problems}
					\question A capacitor in an RC circuit has a capacitance of 40$\mu$F while the resistor has a resistance of 20K$\Omega$. If the capacitor is initially empty, answer the following questions: ($Q(t)=Q(1-e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}})$)
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Calculate the amount of time it would take the charge in the capacitor to reach 63\%. \\ \\
						We know that the time it takes for an empty capacitor to charge up to 63\% is $\tau$.
						$$\tau=RC=40\times10^{-6}\text{F}\times2\times10^4\Omega$$
						$$\tau=0.8\text{sec}$$
						\item Calculate the amount of charge left when $\dfrac{2}{5}\tau$ amount of time has dissipated.
						$$Q(t)=Q(1-e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}})$$
						We have been given that $t=\dfrac{2}{5}\tau$, thus plugging that in, we get:
						$$Q(t)=Q(1-e^{-\dfrac{\frac{2}{5}\tau}{\tau}})$$
						$$Q(t)=Q(1-e^{-\dfrac{2}{5}})$$
						If you didn't have a calculator in the exam, as with most students, this is enough simplification. If you want to simplify it further down, you can, but it's not important. The answer above is good enough.
					\end{itemize}
					\question How far apart are two conducting plates that have an electric field strength of  6.40×$10^3$V/m  between them, if one of the plates has a potential of -4.0KV and the other has a potential of 6.0KV? \\ \\
					We know that $\Delta V=Ed$, but first let's calculate the potential difference.
					$$\Delta V=6.0KV-(-4.0KV)$$
					$$\Delta V=10.0KV$$	
					To find the distance between the plates, we can rearrange the equation above to the one below:
					$$d=\dfrac{\Delta V}{E}$$
					$$d=\dfrac{10KV}{6.40\times10^3 V/m}=\dfrac{10^4}{6.40\times10^3}m=\dfrac{10}{6.4}m$$
					\question On a planet whose radius is  \textbf{2R}, the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the planet is \textbf{g/3}. What is the mass of the planet in terms of Earth's mass if the radius of the Earth is R and the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth is \textbf{g}?($g=\dfrac{GM}{R^2}$) \\ \\
					For Earth, we know that $g=\dfrac{GM}{R^2}$, which measn $M=\dfrac{gR^2}{G}$. For the planet, $g_p=\dfrac{GM_p}{R_p^2}$, but we have been given in the question that $g_p=\dfrac{g}{3}$ while $R_p=2R$. Plugging in those values in to the planets acceleration due to gravity expression, we get 
					$$g_p=\dfrac{GM_p}{R_p^2}$$
					$$\dfrac{g}{3}=\dfrac{GM_p}{(2R)^2}$$ 
					$$\dfrac{g}{3}=\dfrac{GM_p}{4R^2}\text{, expressing }M_p\text{ in terms of the other variables, we get:} $$
					$$M_p=\dfrac{4gR^2}{3G}=\dfrac{4}{3}\times\dfrac{gR^2}{G}=\dfrac{4}{3}\times M$$
					Thus, the planet is $\dfrac{4}{3}$ times more massive than the Earth.
					\subsubsection*{Extra Credit Problem}
					\question Calculate the Schwarzschild radius of a hypothetical subatomic particle that has a mass of 700Gev/c$^2$. Explain why you think if whether that this particle can ever turn into a black hole or not? \\ \\
					To calculate the Swarzschild radius, we know that the escape speed should be \textbf{c}. Thus,
					$$c=\sqrt{\dfrac{2GM}{R}}$$
					Rearranging variables to express R in terms of the others, we get:
					$$R=\dfrac{2GM}{c^2}$$
					For this specific particle we have to convert its mass into kilograms. To do that let's see what 1Gev/c$^2$ is in terms of kilograms.
					$$1Gev/c^2=10^9\times ev/c^2$$
					$$1Gev/c^2=10^9\times 1.6\times10^{-19}\text{J}/(3\times10^{8}m/s)^2$$
					$$1Gev/c^2\approxeq1.78\times10^{-27}kg$$
					This means, a 700Gev/c$^2$ particle will weigh $700\times1.78\times10^{-27}kg\approxeq1.25\times10^{-25}kg$\\ 
					We can then plug this in to our equation we have above:
					$$R=\dfrac{2\times6.67\times10^{-11}\times1.25\times10^{-25}kg}{(3\times10^8m/s)^2}$$
					$$R=1.853\times10^{-52}m$$
					Theoretically, the smallest possible length or quantized distance  between two points is the Planck length, which is $1.6\times10^{-36}m$, we do see that the Swarzschild radius we found is much, much smaller than the Planck length telling us that the chance of this particle turning into a black hole is zero.
