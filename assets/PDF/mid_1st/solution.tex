					\question When you push a door farther from the hinges, why does it open more fast?
					\begin{choices}
						\choice It opens fast, because the lever arm is shorter so
						the torque is large.
						\choice It opens fast, because the lever arm is longer so the
						torque is large.
						\choice It opens fast, because the lever arm is shorter so
						the torque is less.
						\choice It opens fast, because the lever arm is longer so
						the torque is less.

					\subsubsection*{Work Out}
					\question Answer the following questions about angular momentum:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Show that the torque of a rotating system can be expressed in terms of the time rate of change of the angular momentum. \\
						\textbf{Answer} \\
						$$\tau_\text{net}=\text{I}\alpha$$
						$$\tau_\text{net}=\text{I}\dfrac{\varDelta\omega}{\text{t}}$$
						$$\tau_\text{net}=\dfrac{\text{I}\varDelta\omega}{\text{t}}$$
						$$\tau_\text{net}=\dfrac{\varDelta\text{L}}{\text{t}}$$
						\item If the net torque on a rotating system is 180Nm and it is acted on for 20 seconds, calculate the angular momentum change it causes. \\
						\textbf{Answer} \\
						$$\tau_\text{net}=\dfrac{\varDelta\text{L}}{\text{t}}$$
						$$\varDelta\text{L}=\tau_{net}t$$
						$$\varDelta\text{L}=\tau_{\text{net}}\text{t}$$
						$$\varDelta\text{L}=180\text{Nm}\times20\text{s}$$
					\end{itemize}
					\question Consider a CD spinning anticlockwise. What is the sum of the instantaneous velocities of two points on both ends of its diameter? \\
					\textbf{Answer} \\
					Look at the figure below for instance. The velocity pairs on the top \& bottom and left \& right are pairs at the ends of diameters. If we calculate the sum of the velocity pairs, we can see that they are both opposite, in which case the sum is 0.

					\question Prove Kepler's Third Law.(\textit{For the sake of simplicity, assume the path of planets is circular)}.  \\
					\textbf{Answer} \\
					The proof is available in the notes.
					\question Given that the moon orbits Earth each 27.3 days and that it is an average distance of $3.84\times10^{8}$m from the center of Earth, calculate the period of an artificial satellite orbiting at an average altitude of 1,500 km above Earthâ€™s surface. \\
					\textbf{Answer} \\
					Use Kepler's third law to calculate the period of the satellite. \\ \\
					Since $\text{T}^2\propto\text{R}^3$,
					$$\dfrac{T^2_{moon}}{R^3_{moon}}=\dfrac{T^2_{satellite}}{R^3_{satellite}}$$
					$$T^2_{satellite}=T^2_{moon}\dfrac{R^3_{satellite}}{R^3_{moon}}$$
					$$T_{satellite}=\sqrt{T^2_{moon}(\dfrac{R_{satellite}}{R_{moon}})^3}$$
					Input the values given and you should get the period of the satellite.
					\question Let there be a hypothetical planet in our solar system that has an average distance of 2AU from the sun. From your proof above, deduce the period of the planet.(\textit{Note that the period of the Earth is 1 year and it is 1AU away from the sun}) \\ \\
					\textbf{Answer:}
					We use the same method as we did in the question above:
					$$T_{planet}=\sqrt{T^2_{earth}(\dfrac{R_{planet}}{R_{earth}})^3}$$
					When we calculate the period this way, it comes out to 2$\sqrt{2}$ years.
