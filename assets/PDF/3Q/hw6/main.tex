		\subsubsection*{Information}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The homework is due on \textbf{Wednesday}, \textbf{April 05}.
			\item You should Work on it \textbf{in groups} and consult me if you have any questions. Cheating within groups is unacceptable.
			\item For purposes of neatness and simplicity of grading, you should do the homework on an \textbf{A-4 paper}.

		\subsection*{Questions}
	\end{center}
	\begin{questions}
		\question An electrical generator is made of a circular coil of 0.50m radius. If there are 500 turns of the coil and it is rotating at a rate of 4000 rpm in a 1.800 T field, answer the following questions.
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item Write the emf as a function of time.
			\item What is the maximum emf?
		\end{enumerate}
		\question The Concorde had a wingspan of 26m and it could fly up to speeds of Mach 2. 
			  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			  	\item What emf is induced between wing tips if the vertical component of the Earth’s field is $3\times10^{-5}T$?
			  	\item Discuss if the induced emf would have a significant effect on the workings of the plane.
			  \end{enumerate}
		\question A large power plant generates electricity at 25.0 kV. An old transformer once converted the voltage to 335 kV. The secondary of this transformer is being replaced so that its output can be 850 kV for more efficient transmission.
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item What is the ratio of turns in the new secondary compared with the old secondary? 
			\item What is the ratio of new current output to old output for the same power? 
		\end{enumerate} 
		\question An RL circuit is made of an inductor of 20mH and a resistor of 20 $\Omega$ that are connected in series. If the circuit includes a battery of 20 V of emf, 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item Write the current and emf as functions of time.
			\item Find the induced EMF 8.00 ms after the switch is turned on.
			\item What direction is the current acting?	
		\end{enumerate} 
		\subsection*{Advanced Problems}
		\question A square loop of side 10 cm is placed 2 cm from a long wire carrying a current that varies with time at a constant rate of 3 A/s as shown in the figure below.
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=1]{1}
		\end{center} 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item Use Ampère’s law and find the magnetic field. 
			\item Determine the magnetic flux through the loop.
			\item If the loop has a resistance of 3$\Omega$, how much induced current flows in the loop? 
		\end{enumerate}
